This Haskell code attempts to use a polymorphic function to perform different operations on different data types. However, it fails to handle the case where the input is not of the expected type, leading to runtime errors.  Specifically, applying the function to an `Int` when it expects a `String` will cause a type mismatch.

```haskell
myPolymorphicFunction :: (Show a) => a -> String
myPolymorphicFunction x = show x ++ " is a " ++ (typeOf x)

typeOf :: a -> String
typeOf x = case x of
  "hello" -> "String"
  123 -> "Integer"
  _ -> "Unknown"

main :: IO ()
main = do
  putStrLn (myPolymorphicFunction "hello")
  putStrLn (myPolymorphicFunction 123) -- This will cause a runtime error
```
